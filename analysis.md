# Transcription Bug Fix Analysis

## Root Cause Identified

**Primary Issue**: The frontend creates mock video objects with `Date.now()` as the video ID, but the backend validates that the video exists in the database before creating a transcription job. Since these mock videos don't exist in the database, the transcription job creation fails.

**Secondary Issues**: 
- Missing environment setup (no `.env` file)
- Dependencies not installed  
- Database may not be initialized

## Frontend Analysis (SingleVideoForm.tsx)

The transcribe button creates a mock video object with `Date.now()` as the ID, then calls the API. However, the backend expects the video to exist in the database first.

**Critical Issues:**
1. Mock video object uses temporary ID that doesn't exist in backend
2. Backend validates video existence before creating transcription job
3. No proper video metadata extraction from YouTube URL

## Backend Analysis

The `/transcription/jobs` endpoint properly validates that the video exists in the database before creating a job. The validation logic at lines 124-128 in `transcription.py` will fail when given a mock video ID.

## Configuration Analysis

- Deepgram API key properly configured with 1Password integration
- Environment setup missing (no `.env` file)
- Dependencies not installed (`uv sync` needed)
- Database initialization required
