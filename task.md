# YouTube Data API Integration
**Status:** InProgress
**Agent PID:** 96872

## Original Todo
**YouTube Data API Integration**
- Set up OAuth 2.0 authentication flow using google-auth-oauthlib and google-api-python-client
- Implement channel URL validation with Python regex patterns for all supported formats (@username, /c/, /channel/, /user/)
- Create FastAPI service layer with Python httpx client for YouTube API calls with rate limiting and error handling
- Add channel metadata retrieval using YouTube Data API v3 Python SDK (name, subscriber count, video count)

## Description
We're building the core YouTube Data API integration for the transcription tool. This implementation will enable users to add YouTube channels by URL, authenticate with Google OAuth 2.0, and automatically retrieve channel metadata (name, subscriber count, video count, thumbnails). The system will validate various YouTube URL formats and handle all authentication flows securely.

This component provides the foundation for discovering and tracking YouTube channels, which is essential before users can select videos for transcription.

## Implementation Plan
Based on my analysis of the existing codebase and YouTube Data API documentation, here's how we'll build the integration:

- [ ] Add missing Google API dependencies to backend/pyproject.toml (google-api-python-client, google-auth-oauthlib, google-auth-httplib2)
- [ ] Create YouTube service layer at backend/app/services/youtube_service.py with OAuth authentication, channel URL validation, and API calls
- [ ] Implement channel validation service at backend/app/domains/channels/services.py with regex patterns for @username, /c/, /channel/, /user/ formats
- [ ] Update FastAPI routes at backend/app/api/routes/channels.py to handle POST, GET, DELETE operations with proper error handling
- [ ] Add OAuth configuration to backend/app/core/config.py for client secrets and redirect URLs
- [ ] Create database migration for any additional channel fields needed
- [ ] Automated test: Unit tests for URL validation regex patterns and mocked YouTube API responses
- [ ] Automated test: Integration tests for OAuth flow and channel metadata retrieval
- [ ] User test: Add a YouTube channel URL through the API and verify channel metadata is correctly retrieved and stored

## Notes
- The existing database schema already supports the required YouTube metadata fields
- Frontend services are already structured and typed - no changes needed initially
- Will use environment variables for OAuth client secrets (not stored in database)
- Rate limiting and quota management will be handled in the YouTube service layer
- OAuth flow will be simplified for API-only access (no web redirect flow initially)
