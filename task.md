## Original Todo
Simple channel input form in frontend

## Description
Build a simple channel input form component to replace the current default Vite React template in the frontend. The form will allow users to enter a YouTube channel URL, validate it using the existing backend validation endpoint, and create a new channel record. The form will be integrated into the main App component and use the existing React Query infrastructure for API communication.

## Implementation Plan
How we are building it:
- [x] Create a simple ChannelForm component with URL input field and submit button (frontend/src/components/ChannelForm.tsx)
- [x] Add validation endpoint to the frontend channels service (frontend/src/services/channels.ts:validateChannelUrl)
- [x] Create useValidateChannel hook for URL validation (frontend/src/hooks/useChannels.ts)
- [x] Replace default Vite template in App.tsx with the new ChannelForm component (frontend/src/App.tsx:1-50)
- [x] Style the form using Tailwind CSS with dark mode support
- [x] Add form state management for URL input, validation, and submission
- [x] Implement error handling and loading states for both validation and creation
- [x] Display success message with channel details after successful creation
- [x] Set up testing infrastructure (Vitest + React Testing Library) for component testing
- [x] Automated test: Create basic component test for ChannelForm
- [x] User test: Verify form validates URLs, creates channels, and displays feedback properly
