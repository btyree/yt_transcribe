## Original Todo
Install Python YouTube Data API client library

## Description
The task is to install the Python YouTube Data API client library, but research shows it's already installed and properly configured. The real work needed is to implement the actual YouTube API service layer to replace the current mock implementation.

## Implementation Plan
Since the Python YouTube Data API client library is already installed, this task involves:
- [ ] Verify dependencies are properly installed - Check `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files (backend/pyproject.toml:20-22)
- [ ] Document current installation status - Update task documentation to reflect actual state
- [ ] Validate installation - Test import of google-api-python-client in backend environment
- [ ] Create service foundation - Add basic YouTube API service structure to utilize installed library (backend/app/services/youtube_api.py)
- [ ] Update task completion - Mark as complete since dependencies are already installed and configured

## Notes
Dependencies already installed:
- google-api-python-client>=2.177.0
- google-auth-oauthlib>=1.2.2
- google-auth-httplib2>=0.2.0
