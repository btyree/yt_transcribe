## Original Todo
- [ ] Video list display with basic metadata

## Description
We need to build a video list display component that shows videos from a YouTube channel with basic metadata. This will integrate into the existing user flow after a channel is successfully added, displaying videos with key information like title, thumbnail, duration, view count, and publish date. The component should follow the existing design patterns using Tailwind CSS and dark mode support, and leverage the already-implemented backend API endpoints and React Query hooks.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Create VideoCard component (frontend/src/components/VideoCard.tsx) - Display video thumbnail, title, duration, view count, publish date with Tailwind CSS and dark mode support
- [x] Create VideoList component (frontend/src/components/VideoList.tsx) - Use useVideosByChannel hook, handle loading/empty states, render VideoCard grid, trigger video discovery
- [x] Integrate into App.tsx (frontend/src/App.tsx:40-50) - Add VideoList below success message when createdChannel exists
- [x] Automated test: Test VideoList component rendering and data fetching
- [x] User test: Verify video list displays correctly after adding a channel with existing videos

## Notes
- Backend API endpoints and React Query hooks already implemented
- Follow existing ChannelForm.tsx patterns for UI consistency
- Use useVideosByChannel(channelId) and useDiscoverVideos() hooks
