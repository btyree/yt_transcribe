# Project Setup and Architecture Design
**Status:** InProgress
**Agent PID:** 96872

## Original Todo
**Project Setup and Architecture Design**
- Initialize Python FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM and React/TypeScript frontend using Vite
- Set up development environment with proper tooling (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, pylint, black, mypy)
- Create basic folder structure separating backend/ (Python) and frontend/ (TypeScript/React) components
- Set up SQLite database with SQLAlchemy models (Channels, Videos, Transcription_Jobs tables)

## Description
Based on my research, I need to create the foundational setup for a YouTube transcription tool with a modern, production-ready architecture. This involves initializing both a Python FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM and a React/TypeScript frontend using Vite, along with all necessary development tooling and database models.

The current project has comprehensive documentation but zero code implementation. I'll establish the complete development environment with proper folder separation, dependency management, database schema, and development tooling (linting, formatting, type checking) for both frontend and backend components.

## Implementation Plan
Based on the research and current project state, here's how I'll build the project setup and architecture:

- [x] Create backend/ directory structure with FastAPI + SQLAlchemy domain-driven architecture
- [x] Set up Python dependencies and configuration (pyproject.toml, requirements files, .env.example)
- [x] Configure development tooling for Python (ruff, mypy, pre-commit hooks)
- [x] Create SQLAlchemy database models for Channels, Videos, and TranscriptionJobs tables
- [ ] Set up FastAPI application with basic configuration, CORS, and health endpoints
- [ ] Create frontend/ directory structure with React + TypeScript + Vite feature-based architecture
- [ ] Set up Node.js dependencies and configuration (package.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json)
- [ ] Configure development tooling for frontend (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- [ ] Create basic API service layer and type definitions for backend integration
- [ ] Set up database initialization and test both backend and frontend development servers
- [ ] Automated test: Verify backend server starts and serves health endpoint
- [ ] Automated test: Verify frontend development server starts and builds successfully
- [ ] User test: Start both development servers concurrently and verify they communicate

## Notes
- Using SQLite initially for simplicity, but structure supports PostgreSQL migration later
- Following domain-driven design for backend with separate modules for channels, videos, transcription_jobs
- Using async SQLAlchemy for better performance with concurrent transcription jobs
- Frontend uses feature-based organization for scalability
- All development tooling configured for production-ready code quality
